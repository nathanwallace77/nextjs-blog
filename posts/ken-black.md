Ken Black have been trading for over 10 years from their 4 stores across southern-east Ireland, each stocking a wide range of toys for young children and nursery products. They specialise in toys, outdoor toys, nursery products and gaming products – meaning they have a wide reach of customers.

Stocking several thousand products, Ken Black fully self-manage their new channel of sales through the eCommerce platform admin – which is deeply integrated with their internal technology and store systems.

The eCommerce site offers a wide range of functionality which enables Ken Black’s customers to enjoy browsing and purchasing, including:
* Delivery methods: C&C (click and collect) and home delivery options for customers to safely purchase products at a great price
* Automated delivery surcharging, for special courier delivery orders
* Vardells integration for stock and product information and order syncing
* Product review system, for customers to rate previously purchased product via the PDP

Remarkable are looking forward to a long relationship with Ken Black as they move forwards with their eCommerce efforts.
