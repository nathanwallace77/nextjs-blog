Here, at Remarkable, we are aware that keeping our team hydrated will aid them to perform at their very best throughout the working day.

As a result, we decided to invest in [AquAid watercoolers](https://www.aquaidwatercoolers.co.uk/).

Our unique relationship with **AquAid** has also given our company the opportunity to help those less fortunate than ourselves, because with each purchase an automatic donation is made to the **Africa Trust**.

These funds are used to build ‘Elephant Pumps’ – a modified version of an age old Chinese rope pulley system. One such pump is currently being installed in Africa on our behalf and it will be a much needed source of clean and fresh drinking water for many.

Our organisation’s name will be proudly displayed on our well and we look forward to adding a photo and letters of thanks from the villagers to our site in the near future.

To date AquAid have built over 8,000 such Elephant Pumps across parts of Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe; and have donated in excess of £16 million to charity.
