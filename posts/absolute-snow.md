The Boarding Company Limited (TBCL) is also one of the largest independent retailers for outdoor extreme sports in the UK, not just snow sports. We have worked with TBCL for many years and enjoy a strong partnership where we support their eCommerce business by providing the technology and infrastructure to allow for their growth. Their first eCommerce site (bargainboards.co.uk) was launched back in September 2005 and grew to be a huge early success in the online sports marketplace. Fast forward 15 years and the site [absolute-snow.co.uk](absolute-snow.co.uk) is a powerhouse with nearly 40,000 items available to buy on their site.

Since the site’s redevelopment in 2017 the team at Absolute Snow have worked incredibly closely with their dedicated development team at Remarkable Commerce, this close partnership has enabled many key developments and innovations to be launched, propelling the site forwards and remaining current against its competitors.

To support their large order volume, Absolute Snow relies on the Remarkable Commerce Platform and the in-built OMS (Order Management System) which has custom functionality for grouping order types and allowing the retailer to dispatch efficiently – keeping customers happy and coming back regularly.

We would like to congratulate Absolute Snow for this fantastic accolade and are looking forward to many years of continued growth and a strengthened partnership.
